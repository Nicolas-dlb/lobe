					Your results show you which images your model is predicting correctly
					and incorrectly. Correct predictions have green labels and incorrect
					predictions have red labels. The width of the label bar represents how
					confident the model was in that prediction.

				<p className="mb-5">
					Hovering over a predicted label will show the true label you gave that
					image. The more correct the predictions, the better the model is
					performing.

					<p className="mb-4">
						Test images are a random subset of your examples that Lobe hides
						from your model during training. Lobe automatically splits your
						examples into two parts:
						<br></br>
						<br></br>
						Random 80% is used to train your model.
						<br></br>
						<br></br>
						Random 20% is held out and used to test your model.
						<br></br>
						<br></br>
						See the results on only your held out test images by selecting{" "}
						<strong>View {">"} Test Images</strong>. If your overall performance
						on All Images is very high and your performance withTest Images is
						lower, your model may be memorizing your examples instead of
						learning to generalize to unseen images. This is often
						calledoverfitting.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-5">To help prevent overfitting, you can:</p>
					<ul className="mb-7">
						<li>
							Collect more images overall so the training set includes more
							variations.
						</li>
						<li>Make sure your images donâ€™t look too similar to each other.</li>

						When you are happy with the results, you should try out the model in
						the real world! Experiment on new images with Play, or Export the
						model to use in your app. Try to trick your model with new images
						that test its limits, and add those images as examples to improve
						your model.
